# Uniswap Bot 1

Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol. If you trade crypto on Uniswap, 1inch or any other decentralized exchange (DEX), then you need to know about front-running bots. 
Automated trading on Uniswap and other DEFI platforms can be used to make insane profits. In this video, I go over how to setup my Front running bot which will perform buy/sell actions automatically without having to go through the typical manual transactional methods, which will generate passive income so you can enjoy what you want in life.

======== FAQ ========

Will the Merge affect this?
No, it will not. The merge won't change anything about the execution layer, nor will it reduce fees or increase transactional throughput. 

Can I turn off my computer?
Yes. Once the smart contract has been deployed it lives on the blockchain. Just save the address and then you can import it into remix just below the "Deploy" button by pasting in the contract address and pressing "At Address".

How can I give back to you?
Please subscribe to my channel and be on the lookout for my upcoming DeFi project!

Does this work on other chains like BSC?
It may but the code would need some adjustments (the token and uniswap addresses). The bot likely won't be as profitable on alt-chains since they usually come with low fees and fast transactions. Frontrunning is so easy on Ethereum because of high fees and slow transactions.
